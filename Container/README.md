# The Container

Here is the Dockerfile I've used for most of the exploits. It's essential to have a viable container to properly run and test the vulnerable program.
Then we can use the knowledge we gain from the testing in order to build a proper exploit.

## Container building steps

- Find the vulnerability for the program in question (this can either be through vulnerability research, or on the CVE database)
- Obtain the vulnerable version of the program (this helps if the program is open source so you can build from source)
- Find the dependencies for the program (this can be done with `apt build-dep <program>` or just looking through the source website)
- Add the dependencies to the install list in the `Dockerfile`
- Add the commands for compiling the program to the `Dockerfile` (this usually involves `wget <source>`, `./configure`, `make`, `make install` but you
  can verify on the website of the source)
- Make the `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` of the `Dockerfile` be the program itself so it will run when the container is run.

This should give you a good starting container to debug the program and build an exploit. For debugging, you can use `pwndbg`. If you would like to
run the exploit inside the container, make sure the exploit gets copied into the container filesystem and that the dependencies for the exploit are
installed on the container.

## Things to note

- Debian doesn't always work, so I've replaced it with Ubuntu in some instances. Sometimes it's much easier to change the base OS than it is to fix
  whatever problems are causing the program to not compile.
- It's important to use whatever debugging program you feel most comfortable with. For one of these, I was forced to use plain GDB for much of the
  debugging making the process much slower.
