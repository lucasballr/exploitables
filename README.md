# exploitables

Here is a repository of known exploitable programs. The purpose of this project is to bridge the gap between what we see in the gamified environment
of a ctf and the real world. It also attempts to tackle the issue of moving from a school environment to a real-world scenario of exploit writing.
This attempts to show what it really is like building exploits. Each CVE covered here teaches something different about crossing this bridge.
